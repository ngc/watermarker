# Watermarker
---

## Project Info

Automatic advanced watermark producing tool. This tool uses randomized image distortion and randomized placement in order to circumvent new machine learning approaches which automatically strip watermarks from images. This also prevents people from using simple image editors from editing out the watermarks without cropping or losing portions of the image. This tool will help to ensure security of your names, logos, symbols, etc. on your images.

## Usage Examples
---

Let's think of a hypothetical yet possible scenario in which for some reason NASA wanted to watermark this image to avoid the Space Force taking credit for it.
